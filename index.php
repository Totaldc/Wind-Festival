                <p>The Squamish Wind Festival For The Arts is excited to announce that we will be hosting three drive-in movie nights each Friday evening between Aug 7th and 21st at a large venue in Squamish, BC (details TBC). Each night we will have a local musician or band perform at 7pm with the movie kicking off at 9pm. We will have socially distanced stalls with a maximum vehicle count of 50 cars and reservations will be done online, once we are sold out we will clearly state that on the website as no walk-in traffic will be available. We are working closely with health officials and their phased approach for event guidelines to ensure we are a safe and socially distanced event. Proceeds support the local arts community in Squamish.</p>
